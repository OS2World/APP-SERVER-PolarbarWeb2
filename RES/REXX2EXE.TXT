       Short Description: Free rexx "compiler" (generates .EXE from .CMD)
        Long Description: This tool has many generation options and allowes
                          you to create PM programs (makes using
                          RxMessageBox() easier), standalone programs or
                          smaller programs that require a generated DLL.
                          The code is optionally encrypted and packed so
                          the generated code can be quite small.
